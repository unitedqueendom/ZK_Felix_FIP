			<p>The website is for gamers who want to share their funny or sad stories. The main reason of creating this site is we saw a emotional story of a gamer called 00WARTHERAPY00, his father bought a xbox and played with him when he was a kid. Unfortunately，his father passed when he was 6, in the following 10 years, he was afraid to play that xbox. Until one day he launched a game and found a "ghost car" racing with him. He realized that was his father's hightest record.

			The website is for those gamers who has same experience or something that you want us to hear. we are here to bring all gamers together and enjoy your story.
